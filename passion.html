								<h3>The Spark of Interest</h3>
								<p>My fascination with data science began in the transaction screening team, where I encountered the power of data in solving real-time business problems. We developed a solution to reduce manual intervention in recurrent transactions by 95%, which was my first taste of the impact data science could make. This experience was the spark that ignited my passion for the field.</p>
								<h3>Embracing the Challenge</h3>
								<p>The transition to data science was a journey filled with learning curves and challenges. From mastering complex concepts to adapting to new technologies, every step was a leap towards growth. The discovery of ChatGPT was a turning point, revealing the vast potential of AI in solving business problems and pushing me to expand my focus from data science to AI.</p>
								<h3>Passion for Machine Learning</h3>
								<p>Among the various facets of data science, machine learning captivated me the most. The magic of teaching machines to learn from data and make predictions was not just fascinating, it was a glimpse into the future. This passion for machine learning has become a driving force in my pursuit of knowledge and innovation in the field.</p>
								<h3>Aspiring to Make a Difference</h3>
								<p>Looking ahead, my ambition is to become an advocate for innovation and change in data science. I aspire to bridge the gap between technical complexity and clarity, helping non-technical teams understand the significance of staying abreast with current trends and embracing data-driven decision-making.</p>
								<h3>A Continuous Journey</h3>
								<p>My journey in data science is a continuous path of exploration, learning, and growth. With each project, I uncover new insights and possibilities. As I delve deeper into this fascinating field, I am excited about the opportunities to contribute to meaningful change and innovation in the world of data.</p>
